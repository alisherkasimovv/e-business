# Responsive Design

Based on the provided search results, here are the key responsive design best practices:

## Use a mobile-first approach

* Design for mobile screens first, then scale up to larger viewports.
* Prioritise the most important content and elements for mobile, then add additional content/features for larger screens.
* This helps create a minimalist, user-friendly design that works well across devices.

## Ensure responsive functionality over identical design

* Layouts, images, and content may need to adapt differently across devices to maintain usability.
* Focus on providing a consistent user experience rather than an identical visual design.
* Optimise for mobile by making buttons/links large enough for touch, minimising text, and stacking content vertically.

## Implement at least 3 breakpoints

* Use breakpoints for desktop, tablet, and mobile to ensure your design scales properly.
* Customise breakpoints based on your target audience's device usage, not just standard screen sizes.
* This allows your website to adapt to the wide range of devices people use to access it.

## Optimise images and media

* Use responsive image techniques like cropping, resizing, and vector graphics (SVGs) to ensure visuals look great on any screen.
* Minimise file sizes to improve load times, especially for mobile users.

## Simplify navigation and content

* Streamline the navigation menu, hiding less important links on mobile.
* Break up content into scannable sections with headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs.
* Eliminate unnecessary elements that could clutter the interface on smaller screens.

## Test extensively across devices

* Validate your design and functionality on a variety of real devices, not just emulators.
* Continuously monitor performance and user feedback to identify areas for improvement.
By following these responsive design best practices, you can create websites that provide an optimal user experience regardless of the device or screen size.
