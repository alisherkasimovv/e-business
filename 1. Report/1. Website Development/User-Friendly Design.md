# User-Friendly Design

1. **Clear Navigation:** Make sure your website has a clear and simple navigation bar with easily identifiable categories like genre, author, new releases, etc. A user-friendly search bar is also crucial. Search bar should give results on-the-fly while the user is entering his query.
2. **Visually Appealing:** Use high-quality book cover images and showcase curated selections on the homepage. Include author bios and blurbs to entice readers.
3. **Mobile-Friendly:** Ensure your website is responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, especially mobile devices where a significant portion of browsing happens.
