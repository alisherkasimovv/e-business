# Analytics

Email marketing metrics are the key performance indicators (KPIs) that help measure campaign performance. [6] The email marketing metrics that we suggest to measure are:

* **Open rate** - the percentage of email recipients who open your campaign.
* **Click-through rate** - the percentage of your subscribers who click on a link in your campaign.
* **Click-to-open rate** - the percentage of subscribers who opened your newsletter and clicked a link inside it.
* **Bounce rate** - the percentage of subscribers who didnâ€™t receive your email marketing campaign due to their email addresses being invalid or otherwise undeliverable. This would show if the email list needs to be looked through and cleared of inactive subscribers.
* **Spam complaint rate** - the number of subscribers who report your campaign as spam.
* **Unsubscribe rate** - the percentage of campaign recipients who unsubscribe from your campaign.
