# Segmentation

Email segmentation is the process of dividing and separating email subscribers into groups or segments based on criteria using tags and segments in your email marketing platform.[5] The segmentation would be done by:

* **Location:** if there are many bookstores located all over the UK, to offer the best deals in the stores near the user the users would be segmented in as little groups as the regions where the stores are located. For international transactions users from Europe, Asia, Oceania, America, Africa will be segmented;
* **Demographics:** based on the analysis between 4 of the most popular UK bookstore websites Fig. 2. we suggest segmenting the users in the age groups 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54,55-65+ this is because there are less users over 54 who are visiting bookstore in UK websites.
* **Gender**
* **Item preferences:** Based on the book genres, other items such as gifts, stationary items, job offer searching;
* **Account type:** employee, website admin, customer as a person, customer as a business, supplier;
* **Customer traits:** visit frequency, the length of subscription, purchase frequency;
