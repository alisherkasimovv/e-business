# Email Campaigns

Adding an item to the wishlist reminds the user about the items in the wishlist by email when:

* it goes on sale
* once every month
* when the item is low on stock

Twice a month the user receives a newsletter of items that are chosen by a recommender system based on this data:

* items on user’s wishlist
* items searched on the website
* items that are looked at

Other occasions when the user receives an email:

* if there’s a sale the user will receive 1 email
* if there’s an abandoned cart left the user will receive 3 reminder emails (1 email per week)
* after a purchase the receipt, shipping information and some item recommendations

## Email writing tips

1. Craft a Compelling Subject Line: Your subject line is the first thing recipients see. Make it engaging and relevant to increase the open rate. Use action words, ask a question, or create a sense of urgency.

    *Example:* "Unlock 20% Off – Limited Time Offer Just for You!"

2. Personalise Your Email: Use the recipient’s name and other personal details to make the email feel more tailored and relevant. Personalised emails have higher engagement rates.

    *Example:* "Hi [First Name], we've got something special for you!"

3. Keep It Short and Sweet: People have limited time, so make your email concise and to the point. Highlight the key message and benefits upfront.

    *Example:* "We’re excited to introduce our new summer collection. Enjoy exclusive discounts just for you!"

4. Include a Clear Call to Action (CTA): Make sure your email has a clear, prominent CTA that tells the reader exactly what you want them to do. Use actionable language.

    *Example:* "Shop Now" or "Get Your Discount"

5. Segment Your Audience: Divide your email list into segments based on demographics, behaviour, or preferences. This allows you to send more targeted and relevant content.

    *Example:* "As a loyal customer, you get early access to our new arrivals!"

6. Use Eye-Catching Design: A well-designed email with images, proper formatting, and easy-to-read fonts can keep your audience engaged. Ensure it’s mobile-friendly.

    *Example:* Include high-quality images of your products and use a clean, professional layout.

7. Provide Value: Offer something of value to your readers, whether it’s a discount, exclusive content, or helpful information. This encourages them to stay subscribed and engage with your emails.

    *Example:* "Download our free guide to summer styling tips!"

8. Test and Optimise: Conduct A/B testing on different elements of your emails (subject lines, CTAs, content) to see what works best. Use the data to continually improve your campaigns.

    *Example:* "Test different subject lines to see which one gets a higher open rate."

9. Ensure Compliance: Make sure your emails comply with relevant laws and regulations, such as the CAN-SPAM Act. Include an easy way for recipients to unsubscribe.

    *Example:* "Click here to unsubscribe if you no longer wish to receive our emails."

10. Analyze Performance: Use email marketing analytics to track open rates, click-through rates, and conversions. Use this data to refine your strategy and improve future campaigns.

    *Example:* "Our last campaign had a 25% open rate and 10% click-through rate. Let’s analyze why and make adjustments."
