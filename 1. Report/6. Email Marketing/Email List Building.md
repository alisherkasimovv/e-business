# Email List Building

The website will save a userâ€™s email address by the user registering on the website this can be done through logging on Google or creating a new account see the example in Fig 1.. Then the website sends a confirmation email to verify their email address and confirm their subscription to ensure that the email list only includes legitimate email addresses.
