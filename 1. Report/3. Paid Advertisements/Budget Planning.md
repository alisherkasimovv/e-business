# Targeting

To ensure the success of your paid ad campaigns, it's crucial to carefully plan budget, allocate finances based on the strengths of each ad platform, and continuously monitor and adjust based on performance metrics. This strategic approach helps maximise the impact of your advertising efforts, driving higher engagement and conversions.

Primary objective of campaign e.g., increase sales, boost website traffic, enhance brand awareness should be defined as well as key performance indicators (KPIs) such as click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate, cost per click (CPC), and return on ad spend (ROAS) should be identified.

*As per for budgeting monthly budget should be set as below example:*

Let’s assume a total monthly budget of $10 000. Duration of the campaign will be 3 months.  Total budget = Monthly budget × Campaign duration. ($10 000 × 3 months = $30 000 total budget)

## Platform Allocation

Based on the advantages and one of the two target audience categories on each platform, budget should be allocated. Here’s a sample allocation strategy:

Table. Budget allocation

| Platform | Percentage of Total Budget | Monthly Allocation | Total Allocation (3 Months) |
|:---:|---:|---:|---:|
|LinkedIn Sponsored Content | 40% | $4,000 | **$12,000** |
| Google Search Ads | 35% | $3,500 | **$10,500** |
| Facebook Ads | 25% | $2,500 | **$7,500** |
| **Total** | **100%** | **$10,000** | **$30,000** |

### LinkedIn Sponsored Content

* Budget: $4,000/month
* Target CPC: $5 (average CPC for LinkedIn is higher due to professional targeting)
* Estimated Clicks: Monthly clicks = Budget / CPC = $4,000 / $5 = 800 clicks
* Assumed Conversion Rate: 3%
* Estimated Conversions: 800 clicks × 3% = 24 conversions

### Google Search Ads

* Budget: $3,500/month
* Target CPC: $2 (Google Search Ads have a varied CPC based on industry and competition)
* Estimated Clicks: Monthly clicks = Budget / CPC = $3,500 / $2 = 1,750 clicks
* Assumed Conversion Rate: 5%
* Estimated Conversions: 1,750 clicks × 5% = 88 conversions

### Facebook Ads

* Budget: $2,500/month
* Target CPC: $1.5 (Facebook Ads generally have a lower CPC due to broad reach)
* Estimated Clicks: Monthly clicks = Budget / CPC = $2,500 / $1.5 = 1,667 clicks
* Assumed Conversion Rate: 4%
* Estimated Conversions: 1,667 clicks × 4% = 67 conversions
