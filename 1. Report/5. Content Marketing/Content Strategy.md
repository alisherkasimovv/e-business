Over a quarter (27%) of women read daily, compared to a sixth (13%) of men. Men are also less likely to be readers overall, with 22% saying they never read, compared to 12% of women.”
    * Core genres:
        * Based on the same research by C.Ibbetson “A third of Brits (36%) say they do not have preference when it comes to choosing between fiction and non-fiction, but another third (35%) say they prefer fiction, and 20% prefer non-fiction.Women are much more likely to prefer fiction (42%) than men (29%), and the opposite is also true, with men much more likely to prefer non-fiction (24%) than women (16%). Diving down into the sub-genres, Brits are most tempted by biographies and memoirs (26%) in terms of non-fiction, and fiction readers tend to opt for crime and thriller novels (33%).”[4]
