To create SEO-optimised links for a bookstore:
1. **Internal Links.** Link relevant pages within your site to each other using descriptive anchor text. For instance, link a blog post about "Best Science Fiction Books" to your "Science Fiction" book category page.
2. **Backlinks from Guest Blogging.** Write guest posts for book-related blogs with backlinks to your bookstore. For example, contribute an article on "Top Literary Classics" with a link back to your bookstore's homepage.
3. **Influencer Partnerships.** Collaborate with literary influencers to showcase your bookstore. Have influencers review a popular book from your store on their platforms with a link to your site.
4. **Local Directories.** List your bookstore in local business directories with consistent NAP information. This can provide authoritative backlinks and improve local SEO.
5. **Social Media Engagement.** Share engaging content on social media optimised with relevant keywords and links back to specific book pages on your website.

By implementing these strategies, you can enhance your bookstore's online visibility, attract more visitors, and improve your SEO rankings effectively.
*Google's algorithm is extremely complex, and here are the basic principles it uses to rank websites:*
- Google looks for pages that contain high-quality and relevant information about the user's query.
- It determines relevance by “crawling” through your site's content and assessing (using algorithms) whether that content matches what the user is searching for, typically based on the keywords contained in the content.
- Google determines the “quality” of a site in different ways, but what is still important to it is the number and quality of other websites that link to your page and to your site as a whole

*Google's algorithm also evaluates additional elements to determine where your site will rank, such as:*

How do people interact with your site (do they find the information they need and stay on the site, or return to the search page and click on another link? Or do they simply ignore you in search results?)
- Your website loads quickly and is mobile friendly
- How much unique content you have (vs. low value content or duplicate content)
Google's algorithm considers hundreds of ranking factors in response to search queries, and they are constantly updating and improving their process.
