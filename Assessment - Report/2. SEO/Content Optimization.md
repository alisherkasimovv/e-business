# Content Optimisation

Here is a concise answer to your query about the most important SEO meta tags and how to use them. The most critical meta tags for SEO are:

## Title tag (H1)

Provides a concise, keyword-rich headline summarising the page's content. Ensure it incorporates relevant keywords effectively.

## Meta description tag

A brief snippet that appears in search results under the title. While it doesn't directly impact rankings, a well-crafted description can improve click-through rates.

## Header tags (H2, H3, H4)

Organise content and indicate hierarchy. Including keywords in headers enhances readability and signals structure to search engines.

## Image alt text

Provides alternative text descriptions for images, ensuring accessibility and allowing search engines to understand the image.

## Canonical tags

Specify the preferred version of a page when there are multiple URLs with similar content, preventing duplicate content issues

To optimise these tags:

* Write unique, descriptive titles under 60 characters
* Keep meta descriptions concise and compelling to encourage clicks
* Use header tags to organise content logically, incorporating keywords where relevant
* Include descriptive alt text for all images
* Use canonical tags to point to the main version of a page with duplicate content

Following these best practices will help search engines better understand and rank your pages. The title tag and meta description in particular can influence click-through rates from the SERP.
